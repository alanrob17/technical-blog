### Build a new template for my documents

I write a fair number of documents in Markdown format with the intention of eventually getting the notes into HTML format so that I can view them in a browser. I have been using Bootstrap 3 as a template for my pages to make them a bit more user friendly.

Today I decided that it was about time to update my template into Bootstrap 4. I have been using Bootstrap 4 for my web projects and like the nice modern flat button format and am interested to see how my notes would look in this format.

It took me about an hour to format my notes into Bootstrap 4 and I am happy with the results. I have used the Cosmo theme by Thomas Park. You can download this free theme from [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com//).

I have reformatted my Git training notes with the new template.
