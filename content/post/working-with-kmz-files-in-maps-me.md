**Note:** all screenshots were taken from my Samsung tablet.

I have been saving my location points to **Maps.me** when we travel using my Samsung tablet. As I only download the points once a year it is very easy to forget the method I use to export my points.

Each year I create a new bookmark set, for example this year I created a set named *Victoria-2019* and this is where I saved all of my local points. I can download these points by opening the bookmark set that I want to export.

In *Maps.me* I can click on the bookmarks icon:

![Bookmarks icon](/images/bookmarks-icon.jpg "Bookmarks icon")

This opens a list of all my bookmark sets.

![Bookmark sets](/images/bookmark-sets.jpg "Bookmark sets")

The set I want to export is *Victoria-2019* so I click on that set and it opens up a list of all of my location points.

![Location points](/images/location-points.jpg "Location points")

On the top right hand side of this page is the export icon:

![Export icon](/images/export-icon.jpg "Export icon")

Click on this and it will give you a list of places you can export to.

![Export to](/images/export-to.jpg "Export to")

In my case I want to export to Google Drive so I click on the icon.

![Google Drive export](/images/google-drive-export.jpg "Google Drive export")

By clicking on *Save* it will export to my Google Drive folder.

**Note:** I need to save the set as a **.kmz** file. This is a compressed zip file that I can open later and it contains a **.kml** file that is an *xml* file that I can edit if I need to.

I have now backed up up all of the saved *Maps.me* points to my computer.
