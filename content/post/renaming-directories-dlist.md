I often have to rename directories in the training materials that I download. They never seem to have a consistent file structure so I manually create a batch file to rename the directories. This takes me around 2-3 minutes each time I do it and I find that I am constantly creating batch files to do this task.

Today I spent around 2 hours to automate this process and have run the program on a number of directories to test that it works correctly. It has cut my time down to around 10 seconds for each set of training materials.

I am shocked that I never thought to automate this task before and am pleased that it will save me from some redundant work. At present I am creating a batch file to carry out the task rather than automate the process of renaming the directories. There is the occasional set of folders that will need some manual intervention and this can be done in around 30 seconds.

My next task will be to rename the video files in the sub-directories as this process is very labour intensive and varies depending on the number of subdirectories I have to rename.

**Usage:**

> dlist
